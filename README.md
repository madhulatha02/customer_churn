# customer_churn
Customer churn prediction helps us in analyzing the customer behaviour based on the features.
The objective is to predict whether a customer will discontinue a subscription-based service.
The dataset contains details of 10,000 bank customers, covering demographic, financial, and behavioral factors. The primary goal is to predict whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay with the bank based on these attributes.
# Target Variable:
